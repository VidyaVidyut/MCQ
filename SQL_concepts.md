The core concepts in SQL (Structured Query Language) include:

* **Database:** Collection of tables used for organizing and storing data.

* **Table:** A table is a structured representation of data in rows and columns.

* **Column:** Each column in a table represents a different type of data, such as name, date, or number.

* **Row:** A row in a table represents a single record of data.

* **Primary Key:** A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, used to enforce integrity and establish relationships with other tables.

* **Foreign Key:** A foreign key is used to link two tables together and enforce referential integrity.

* **Index:** An index is used to speed up the search for data in a table by allowing for faster data retrieval.

* **SQL:** Structured Query Language is the standard language used for managing and manipulating data in a database.

* **SQL Statements:** SQL statements are used to perform operations on the data in a database, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

* **Joins:** Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables into a single result set.

* **Views:** Views are virtual tables based on the result of a SELECT statement, providing a simplified way to access data from multiple tables. Views provide a customized and simplified view of data from one or more tables.

* **Stored Procedures:** Stored procedures are pre-written SQL commands that can be executed as a single unit, simplifying database management.

* **Triggers:** Triggers are events that automatically execute a predefined set of actions in response to changes in the data in a database.

* **Data Types:** Specifying the type of data that can be stored in each column, such as integers, text, or dates.

* **Data Integrity:** Ensuring data consistency and accuracy by applying constraints and rules.

* **Transactions:** A transaction is a series of database operations that are executed as a single unit, and either all succeed or all fail.

* **Subqueries:** Subqueries are SQL queries that are nested inside another query.

* **Normalization:** Normalization is the process of organizing a database into multiple tables to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
